      "message": "It sounds like this was a false positive? The first member xfer-\u003emsg is being initialized during spi_message_init_with_transfers(), and it seems the memset(0) here is trying to cover for both transfers xfer-\u003eheader and xfer-\u003edata. So the \"write beyond size of field\" was intentional (maybe ugly though). Perhaps this whole struct definition doesn\u0027t make sense and it should instead be something like:\n\n```\nstruct spi_message m;\nstruct spi_transfers xfers[2];\nu8 buffer[2];\n```",
